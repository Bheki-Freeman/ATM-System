    * An ATM System allows a cutomer to login, then enter an account number, then 
    * They will be able to check their account status, check deposit, 
    * make deposits, make withdrawals
    * They can also make transferes into other accounts
    * The admin on the other hand, is responsible for creating new accounts, 
    * new customers, and even employees 
    * Of course the admin will be doing the CRUD operation into all o' them
    * [For Logins: admin(lik, passlik) and customer(celuxolo, passcelu)]
    * Otherwise sqlite has been used for db
